| [react-native.config.js]({file})   | The code in the "react-native.config.js" file sets the project configuration for React Native. It specifies that the project has separate configurations for iOS and Android. Additionally, it specifies that the project uses custom fonts located in the "./assets/fonts/" directory as assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| [jest.config.js]({file})           | The `jest.config.js` file is used for configuring the testing framework Jest. In this specific code snippet, the file is exporting an object with a single property `preset` set to `'react-native'`. The value `'react-native'` specifies that Jest should use the preset configuration for testing React Native applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [app.json]({file})                 | The code provided is a directory tree structure of a project. It includes various files and folders such as configuration files (.env,.eslintrc.js, prettierrc.js), test files (__tests__), application source code (src/), and other project-related files. The specific code snippet shows the content of the app.json file, which includes the project name as "app" and the display name as "App.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [.prettierrc.js]({file})           | The code in the.prettierrc.js file is configuring the formatting rules for code styling using Prettier. It specifies that arrow function parameters should have no parentheses, curly brackets should be on the same line as the corresponding code block, there should be no spacing between brackets, single quotes should be used for strings, and trailing commas should be added to all elements in an array or object.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [package.json]({file})             | The code represents a directory tree structure of a project along with the package.json file. The directory contains various files and folders related to a React Native app. The package.json file lists the project dependencies, devDependencies, and scripts for running, testing, and linting the app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [metro.config.js]({file})          | The code in the `metro.config.js` file is used to configure Metro, which is the JavaScript bundler that React Native uses. The code sets the transformer property to specify that a specific Babel transformer should be used for SVG files. The resolver property is used to filter out SVG files from the list of asset extensions and add "svg" as a source extension. Overall, this code configures Metro to handle SVG files in a React Native application.                                                                                                                                           |
| [.watchmanconfig]({file})          | This code represents an empty configuration file named `.watchmanconfig` located in the root directory of a project. It is part of a larger directory structure that includes various files and directories related to a React Native application, such as configuration files (`babel.config.js`, `jest.config.js`, `metro.config.js`), source code (`App.tsx`, `api/`, `components/`, `constants/`, `hooks/`, `interfaces/`, `screens/`), and other project-related files (`Gemfile`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`). However, this specific file does not contain any code or configuration settings. |
| [package-lock.json]({file})        | The directory tree represents a codebase for a mobile application. It includes files and folders related to the project's configuration, dependencies (e.g., Gemfile, package.json), testing (__tests__), and deployment (Dockerfile). The main source code resides in the'src' folder, which is organized into subfolders for API, components, constants, hooks, interfaces, and screens. These folders contain the necessary code for the application's functionality, such as API requests, UI components, constants, hooks, and screens for different app sections (e.g., login, dashboard, flux).     |
| [install.sh]({file})               | The code in the `install.sh` file is a shell script that runs the command `npm install`. It is used to install the necessary dependencies for the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [run.sh]({file})                   | The code in the "run.sh" file is a shell script that determines what command to run based on the input parameter. If the parameter is "tests", it runs the "npm run test" command. Otherwise, it runs the "npm run start" command. This script is used to execute either the test suite or the application based on the command-line input.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Gemfile]({file})                  | The code in the Gemfile sets the source to a Ruby Gems repository and defines the minimum required Ruby version as 2.6.10 or higher. It also specifies the cocoapods gem with a version constraint of approximately 1.12. This file is typically used in Ruby projects to manage and install dependencies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| [App.tsx]({file})                  | The code is a React Native app with a directory tree structure. The main functionality is to render the `App` component, which is wrapped in a `ThemeProvider` component. The `App` component imports and renders the `Main` component, and also configures the `GoogleSignin` library. The code enables screens optimization and imports various styles and constants from different files within the project.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [index.js]({file})                 | The code is a React Native entry point that registers the main component of the app. It imports the `App` component from the `App.tsx` file and the `appName` from the `app.json` file. The `AppRegistry.registerComponent` function is then used to register the `App` component with the specified `appName`, allowing it to be rendered as the root component of the React Native app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [.env]({file})                     | The code above represents a directory tree structure of a project. It consists of various files and folders related to a mobile application development project. The specific code snippet is from the.env file, which contains a configuration value defining the API URL for the application. The API URL is set to "http://10.0.2.2:8000", which presumably represents the backend server that the mobile application communicates with.                                                                                                                                                                |
| [client_mobile.Dockerfile]({file}) | The code is a Dockerfile for building a mobile client application. It sets up the environment by installing system dependencies, Java, Node.js, and Android SDK. It also installs Gradle, sets environment variables, and copies the application code.

| [index.tsx]({file}) | The code is part of a React Native application and is located in the `src/screens/Oauth/index.tsx` file. The `Oauth` component is a screen that is rendered when the user needs to complete an OAuth authentication process. It makes use of the `useEffect` hook to execute an asynchronous `oauthAuthorize` function defined in `../../api/api.ts` when the component mounts. The `oauthAuthorize` function takes in a service (provided as a parameter from the previous screen) and a query string extracted from the current URL path. Upon successful completion, the component navigates back by popping two screens from the navigation stack. Otherwise, an error occurs and the same navigation action is performed.The component's layout consists of a centered container with a single text element displaying "Loading..." in a specific font and size. |

| [index.tsx]({file}) | The code in the `src/hooks/getIcon/index.tsx` file exports a function called `getUrlImg`. This function takes in a string parameter called `data` and returns the path to an image icon associated with that data. The function uses a series of if conditions to determine which icon to return based on the input data. If the data matches one of the predefined app names (e.g., "Gmail", "Spotify", "Weather"), the function returns the path to the corresponding icon image. If the data does not match any of the predefined app names, the function returns the path to a default "unknown" icon image. |

| [index.tsx]({file}) | The code is a React Native component called "Main" that checks if a user token is saved and determines whether the user is logged in or not. It uses the React Native components `SafeAreaView`, `StyleSheet`, and `StatusBar`. It imports the navigation container from `@react-navigation/native` and the routing component from `../../screens/Routes`. It also imports `jwt_decode` for decoding the JWT token and `react-native-encrypted-storage` for storing the token securely. It defines a function `checkLogged` that checks if the token is expired and sets the `isLogged` state accordingly. The component is wrapped in a `SafeAreaView` and renders the `Routes` component. |
